# project-365

This project is a personal coding challenge aimed at providing a structured and accountable way for me to improve my coding skills and knowledge in various programming languages and frameworks. The goal is to code every day for an entire year, documenting progress and achievements on GitHub.

As a math and computer science major, this project serves as a means to achieve incremental progress and build foundational knowledge for the next four years. To achieve this, the project will start by following the 100 Days of Code challenge by Angela Yu on python, which will provide a framework for mastering coding basic concepts and hopefullly build side projects for internships.
