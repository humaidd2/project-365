# project-365

It takes years of practice to see progress they said. I figured, why not get a way to get accountable for it. Which is why we have this. I dont know how much I'll be able to do but I have made a commitment to myself on coding everyday for an entire year. I have already gotten started but I figured this way will help me be more accountable.

This is my first year as a math and cs major. I'm curious to see what I will be doing in the next four years, but baby steps right?!

I am firstly going to go through Anglea Yu's 100 days of code, to master concepts and build some side projects for internships this summer.
I will be coding daily and upudating my github with the content. Hopefully this will help me with documentation.

Anyway.
